<h2>RULES</h2>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Admin has the final say in everything</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>This means you can be banned "without good reason".</li>
      <li>Sometimes we have to take actions for the common good even if a rule has not been broken. So behave yourself.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Do not grief</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>This means don't purposely fuck up things for your team mates.</li>
      <li>This also includes killing your team mates for no reason. We will know if you did.</li>
    </ol>

  <li><b>No toxic behavior</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>This includes offensive slurs of all kind, racial or bigotted, as well as racist remarks in general. There are other servers where you can share you hatred of "niggers", "faggots" and "the jews". This isn't one of those servers.</li>
      <li>This also includes being a generally unlikeable and assholish person in the OOC. War sucks. You'll die alot. Refrain from constantly bitching about it.</li>
    </ol>

  <li><b>Do not break the atmosphere of the round</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Do not use internet speak or lingo, and try to avoid referencing current events.</li>
    </ol>

  <li><b>Listen to your superiors</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Follow the chain of command. When your commanding officer tells you to die then you die.</li>
    </ol>

  <li><b>Have fun</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Enjoy my shitty little 40k world. You are going to die, people will forget to bury you and you will cry. But try to get immersed and enjoy this while my sanity remains.</li>
    </ol>

    <li><b>18+</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>This codebase deals with extremely mature themes (sex, insanity, somewhat realistic violence) - I will NOT take risks with having minors. This does not mean we are an ERP server, the opposite actually. ERP will have both IC and possibly OOC consequences if it is unwarranted (I.E. you are not a slaanesh cultist) </li>
    </ol>
