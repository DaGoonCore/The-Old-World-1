They say I am excitable!
Yesterday, over my house
He met a hideous creature without a face
ORDINATORS, KILL THIS BASTARD!
Let's kill!
We always watch you and everything you do to these people.
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer
Everything hurts.
Do you really know what to do?
All will be fine.
And they sit, and they sit.
You taught us how to feel. It was the right decision.
Everything is right at home.
Hell's just at my doorstep.
Think outside of the box.
13 37...
Rip his fucking cock off!
You don't deserve to be loved.
Why are we still here?
Just to suffer?
A disgusting, revolting mass of red flesh.
They are not made of flesh... They are not made of bone...
Parts running without oil in a machine without workers.
Cut, Cut, Cut!
Stab, Stab, Stab!
Violate me.
Everywhere at the end of time.
I have nothing and I can't feel.
Relax, and write some notes.
A heart of copper and steel.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning
I stand amid everything, life burning around me.
How many! How much they squirm
But a dream within a dream?
In everything we see and nothing we hear.
I hold within my head the secrets to death.
Embrace me.
I seem to hate you, I call you a slut.
A whore.
Hedonistic tendancices fawning you on to total deprecation.
It's a madhouse of sticky, unrelating unrest.
Under the stairs, It's all a lie. Go back!
North
East
South
West
Laying underneath the soft solitute.
Graves all over.
Repition.
REPITITION!
Fun until morning, who will remember?
No-one cares about you or your memories.
The sad factory is motionless. Finally.
Kill women.
Kill men.
Kill children.
Gleaming sunlight flowing through the castle doors.
Up, up the dome, up the spire.
The violet, the green, the warmth.
You rear yourself on your throne, still.
The melancholy blood pools underneath you.
There, everything shines above you.
24-Hour-Energy.
